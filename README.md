# AbdomenOrLungs
Here is a "Hello World" application for biomedical image analysis. It determines if a Xray is either an abdomen or lung with about 99% accuracy.

UPDATE:
After running about 50 epochs I have gotten 100% accuracy. Email me at: dev.shobhitagarwal@gmail.com if you want the pictures that I conducted the experiment with. If you want to screenshots of the 100% accuracy you can also email me.


STEPS TO DUPLICATE:
(FOR LINUX)

1. Run the program with python3: python3 main.py
2. Install any missing dependencies with: pip3 install
3. Run the program and let the program predict whether the image is an abdomen xray or chest xray!
